        <p>This is the silly things ive wrote as comments on the start of my blog... as of writing this, it's currently 12:40AM. I am on the camera with my sweet baby girl, double mint. take a look at her plz</p>
        <img src="picture_of_my_baby_girl.png" alt="picture of my beautiful wife" height="720px" width="1080px"/>
        <p>she has been writing on her cool journal for almost an hour which is something i can NEVER DO, which is why i'm learning how to make a website... just so i can do the same in my own passion... ehehehe shes so beautiful i love her. </p>
        <p>her handwriting is so absolutely beautiful like i swear she was just made to write... shes literally the poet but at the same time the subject of these poems. she's just THAT girl.</p>
        <bold>1:01am</bold>
        <p>i just used the bold element for that time check. omg. anyway... i wanna learn viewports this time!!</p>
        <p>What really made me curious about developing websites are how they render in different devices. It seems like a chore having to make a separate website that works for mobile devices right? It's one of the things I want to just casually learn because it's such a lovely skill to have.</p>
        <p>so, everything we will learn about viewport will be put here!</p>

            <p>it has been a while. 2 months, almost, since i've wrote here. a lot has happened since then. I've been really... going through so many changes, and idrk what to do of it. Whenever I try to journal out my feelings it always ends up in a big blur because I can't express myself well as much as I imagine myself in my mind. I always try to think journaling would help me express my feelings more, but I find it hard to express myself for the most part.</p>

            <p>It's really tough at UMAK. I fucking hate it here with every fiber of my being... I wish I could have some luxuries... yknow? Like... at least an aircon... I wish I didn't enroll here too. Idk... I really hate it at this school. It's tough, and I'm tired of pretending that it's okay; it's so not okay. I'm struggling to cope with the biggest changes. The people around me... I can't put myself around them so much. I DONNOOO... i just wish they were like me more.. i wish they had more money... i wish i didn't have to suffer the hot fucking heat for 5 weeks aday. i wish we had online classes.i don't want to be fucking here cooped up in the heat for A DAY. </p>
