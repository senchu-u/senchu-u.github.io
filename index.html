        <img src="picture_of_my_baby_girl.png" alt="picture of my beautiful wife" height="720px" width="1080px"/>
        <p>she has been writing on her cool journal for almost an hour which is something i can NEVER DO, which is why i'm learning how to make a website... just so i can do the same in my own passion... ehehehe shes so beautiful i love her. </p>
        <p>her handwriting is so absolutely beautiful like i swear she was just made to write... shes literally the poet but at the same time the subject of these poems. she's just THAT girl.</p>
        <bold>1:01am</bold>
        <p>i just used the bold element for that time check. omg. anyway... i wanna learn viewports this time!!</p>
        <p>What really made me curious about developing websites are how they render in different devices. It seems like a chore having to make a separate website that works for mobile devices right? It's one of the things I want to just casually learn because it's such a lovely skill to have.</p>
        <p>so, everything we will learn about viewport will be put here!</p>
