        <p>This is the silly things ive wrote as comments on the start of my blog... as of writing this, it's currently 12:40AM. I am on the camera with my sweet baby girl, double mint. take a look at her plz</p>
        <img src="picture_of_my_baby_girl.png" alt="picture of my beautiful wife" height="720px" width="1080px"/>
        <p>she has been writing on her cool journal for almost an hour which is something i can NEVER DO, which is why i'm learning how to make a website... just so i can do the same in my own passion... ehehehe shes so beautiful i love her. </p>
        <p>her handwriting is so absolutely beautiful like i swear she was just made to write... shes literally the poet but at the same time the subject of these poems. she's just THAT girl.</p>
        <bold>1:01am</bold>
        <p>i just used the bold element for that time check. omg. anyway... i wanna learn viewports this time!!</p>
        <p>What really made me curious about developing websites are how they render in different devices. It seems like a chore having to make a separate website that works for mobile devices right? It's one of the things I want to just casually learn because it's such a lovely skill to have.</p>
        <p>so, everything we will learn about viewport will be put here!</p>

            <p>it has been a while. 2 months, almost, since i've wrote here. a lot has happened since then. I've been really... going through so many changes, and idrk what to do of it. Whenever I try to journal out my feelings it always ends up in a big blur because I can't express myself well as much as I imagine myself in my mind. I always try to think journaling would help me express my feelings more, but I find it hard to express myself for the most part.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;">8:48 PM</p>
            <p>It's really tough at UMAK. I fucking hate it here with every fiber of my being... I wish I could have some luxuries... yknow? Like... at least an aircon... I wish I didn't enroll here too. Idk... I really hate it at this school. It's tough, and I'm tired of pretending that it's okay; it's so not okay. I'm struggling to cope with the biggest changes. The people around me... I can't put myself around them so much. I DONNOOO... i just wish they were like me more.. i wish they had more money... i wish i didn't have to suffer the hot fucking heat for 5 weeks aday. i wish we had online classes.i don't want to be fucking here cooped up in the heat for A DAY. </p>

            <p>hi, my blogsite. it's been a few days since i've wrote again. i find it really hard to sneak in programming between everything I have to do for school. I just finished some small task for our groupwork where we have to make a jingle, but I expect more to come.</p>
            <p>on another note, I want to document how I've learnt about &apos;character cases&apos;. Usually, in HTML, it's really hard to use values such as <bold>&lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &apos; &nbsp;, &mdash;</bold> and so on.. it's because these characters are reserved for HTML special characters.</p>
            <p>she &lpar;dachi&rpar; and I have been fighting more. It's gotten really murky for me. I really don't know how to express myself in regard to this&mdash;i feel really tired at some point; not just because of her but of every circumstance I'm in</p>

            <p>what's up chat. i'm learning about meta tables now, but before that: a bit of kwento.</p>
            <p>Dachi and I made up. :&lpar; it's been a sad couple of weeks for me, but maybe I just needed a different perspective of the things around me.. I hope, and continue to hope that everything between us will only get better from now. awa.</p>
            <p>I'm going to be using this space as a way to learn &lt;meta&gt; elements.</p>
